# SmartCam Soccer - New Features Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the new features implemented to improve the SmartCam Soccer backend system.

## New Features

### 1. Past Booking Cleanup with Grace Period

**Problem Solved**: Bookings were not being removed when they ended, causing system confusion.

**Implementation**:

- Added `cleanup_past_bookings()` function that runs every 5 seconds
- Implements a 2-minute grace period (`BOOKING_GRACE_PERIOD = 120` seconds)
- Only removes bookings that have been finished for more than 2 minutes
- Prevents accidental removal of bookings that just ended

**Usage**:

```python
cleanup_past_bookings()  # Called automatically in main loop
```

### 2. Improved Camera Count Tracking

**Problem Solved**: Dashboard showed "0/1 Camera online" even when camera was active.

**Implementation**:

- Added `cameras_online` and `total_cameras` columns to system_status table
- `cameras_online`: 1 if camera is active, 0 if not
- `total_cameras`: Always 1 (we have one camera)
- Updates sent every 5 seconds to dashboard

**Database Changes**:

```sql
-- Run migration: backend/migrations/003_add_camera_tracking_columns.sql
ALTER TABLE system_status ADD COLUMN cameras_online INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE system_status ADD COLUMN total_cameras INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```

### 3. Live Timestamp and Logo Overlays on Recordings

**Problem Solved**: Recordings lacked timestamp and branding.

**Implementation**:

- Added `add_timestamp_overlay()` function for live timestamp display
- Enhanced `overlay_logo()` function for user logo placement
- New `process_video_with_overlays()` function processes videos before upload
- Timestamp shows actual recording time based on booking start time
- Logo position configurable via user settings

**Features**:

- **Live Timestamp**: Shows current time during recording
- **User Logo**: Overlaid on videos based on user settings
- **Scalable Text**: Timestamp size adapts to video resolution
- **Background**: Black background behind timestamp for readability

### 4. Intro Video Integration

**Problem Solved**: No intro video was being added to recordings.

**Implementation**:

- Enhanced `prepend_intro()` function with hardware acceleration
- Automatically adds intro video if configured in user settings
- Uses ffmpeg with hardware encoding for fast processing
- Processes videos immediately after recording ends

**Configuration**:
User settings table should include:

- `intro_video_path`: Path to intro video file
- `logo_path`: Path to user logo image
- `logo_position`: Logo placement ("top-left", "top-right", "bottom-left", "bottom-right")

### 5. Enhanced Video Processing Pipeline

**Problem Solved**: Videos were uploaded without processing.

**Implementation**:

- Videos are now processed immediately after recording ends
- Processing includes: timestamp overlay → logo overlay → intro video → upload
- Supports fallback if processing fails
- Cleans up intermediate files automatically

**Process Flow**:

1. Recording ends
2. Add timestamp and logo overlays
3. Prepend intro video (if configured)
4. Upload to Supabase storage
5. Add database reference with booking_id
6. Clean up local files

## Database Schema Updates

### system_status Table

```sql
-- New columns added
cameras_online INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
total_cameras INTEGER DEFAULT 1
```

### videos Table

```sql
-- New column added
booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
```

## Configuration Requirements

### User Settings

The system expects these settings in the `user_settings` table:

```json
{
  "logo_path": "user_assets/user_logo.png",
  "logo_position": "top-right",
  "intro_video_path": "user_assets/intro.mp4"
}
```

### File Structure

```
backend/
├── user_assets/          # User-specific assets
│   ├── user_logo.png     # User logo for overlays
│   └── intro.mp4         # Intro video
├── temp/                 # Temporary processing files
└── migrations/           # Database migrations
    └── 003_add_camera_tracking_columns.sql
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to validate new features:

```bash
cd backend
python test_new_features.py
```

This will test:

- Past booking cleanup logic
- Camera count tracking
- User settings retrieval
- Database updates

## Performance Optimizations

### Hardware Acceleration

- Uses Pi Camera hardware H.264 encoder
- ffmpeg with hardware acceleration for video processing
- Optimized encoding settings for Pi performance

### Memory Management

- Processes videos in chunks to avoid memory issues
- Cleans up intermediate files immediately
- Caches logos and settings to reduce I/O

### Processing Efficiency

- Videos processed immediately after recording (not during)
- Parallel processing where possible
- Graceful fallbacks if processing fails

## Error Handling

### Robust Fallbacks

- If overlay processing fails, uploads original video
- If intro video missing, skips intro addition
- If database columns missing, uses fallback insert
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Graceful Degradation

- System continues working even if new features fail
- Old functionality preserved as fallback
- Non-critical errors don't stop recording/upload

## Monitoring and Logging

### Enhanced Logging

- All new features include detailed logging
- Success/failure states clearly marked
- Performance metrics logged
- Error context provided for debugging

### Status Updates

- Camera status updated every 5 seconds
- Booking checks every 5 seconds
- Real-time system monitoring

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Multi-camera Support**: Extend camera counting for multiple cameras
2. **Custom Overlays**: More overlay options (score, timer, etc.)
3. **Video Analytics**: Ball tracking overlays during processing
4. **Streaming Integration**: Live overlays during streaming
5. **Cloud Processing**: Offload heavy processing to cloud

### Scalability Considerations

- Processing pipeline designed for multiple video formats
- Overlay system extensible for new overlay types
- Database schema supports future booking enhancements
- Modular design allows easy feature additions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera count shows 0/1**:

- Check if migration 003 was run
- Verify system_status table has new columns
- Check camera initialization in logs

**Overlays not appearing**:

- Verify logo file exists at specified path
- Check user_settings table configuration
- Review processing logs for errors

**Videos not processing**:

- Ensure ffmpeg is installed with hardware support
- Check temp directory permissions
- Verify user_assets directory exists

**Bookings not cleaning up**:

- Check system clock synchronization
- Verify booking end times are correct
- Review cleanup function logs

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check system status
python -c "from main import update_camera_status; update_camera_status(True, False)"

# Test booking cleanup
python -c "from main import cleanup_past_bookings; cleanup_past_bookings()"

# Run full test suite
python test_new_features.py
```

## Summary

The new features provide:

- ✅ Automatic past booking cleanup with grace period
- ✅ Accurate camera count tracking (1/1 when active)
- ✅ Live timestamp overlays on recordings
- ✅ User logo overlays on recordings
- ✅ Intro video integration
- ✅ Comprehensive video processing pipeline
- ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging
- ✅ Database schema improvements
- ✅ Performance optimizations

These improvements make the SmartCam system more reliable, professional, and user-friendly.
